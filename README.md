## Project Overview

This project is a collaborative effort aimed at analyzing customer feedback for skincare products and predicting the sentiment (positive or negative) for each review using an **unsupervised model**. The system includes a **web application** where users can input reviews and get real-time sentiment predictions based on a **pre-trained unsupervised model** for sentiment analysis.

### Key Features
- üìä **Sentiment analysis** for skincare product reviews using an unsupervised model.
- üåê **Web application** for real-time sentiment predictions.
- ‚ö° **ETL pipeline** built using **Azure Data Factory**, **Azure Databricks**, and **Azure Synapse Analytics**.
- üöÄ **Optimized for large-scale data processing** with Azure services.

## Tech Stack

- **Azure Data Factory** for ETL orchestration
- **Azure Databricks** for data processing
- **Azure Synapse Analytics** for data storage and analysis
- **Unsupervised model** for sentiment analysis
- **Flask** for the web application

## Setup

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.12 or higher
- Azure Subscription (can be student subscription)
- Access to Azure Data Factory, Databricks, and Synapse Analytics
- Flask for running the web app


## Repository Access
   - Ensure all team members have access to the shared repository.
   - Collaborate using branches for feature development.
   
## ETL Pipeline

The ETL pipeline is designed to handle large volumes of customer feedback data:

- **Azure Data Factory**: Ingests raw review data from various sources.

## Model Details

This project leverages a **pre-trained unsupervised sentiment analysis model** to classify product reviews as **positive** or **negative**. The model is used in the web app for internal real-time predictions but is not designed for API usage or external requests.

## Website

The web application allows users to submit product reviews and instantly receive sentiment predictions based on the unsupervised model.

### Key Features:
- Simple and intuitive interface for entering product reviews.
- Displays the predicted sentiment of the review.
- Deployed using **Flask**.

## Power BI Dashboard

A **Power BI dashboard** is used for advanced data visualization and analysis, allowing users to explore trends in review data:

- **Sentiment distribution** for skincare products.
- **Top-rated products** based on customer feedback.
- **Time-based analysis** of reviews.
